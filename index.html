            Lots of text that makes you want to look at my portfolio site and somethings that make me look and possibly sound good. <br>Some other things that I could say to make this site look and sound engaging and maybe a few funny comments to make you laugh.
            <br> More text stating that the below are things that I've done and that you should go look at it. <br>Things I would say that would make you want to or consider hiring me after my classes are complete or maybe before.
